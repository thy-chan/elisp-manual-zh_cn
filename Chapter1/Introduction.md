# Introduction
前言

Most of the GNU Emacs text editor is written in the programming language called Emacs Lisp.
You can write new code in Emacs Lisp and install it as an extension to the editor. 
However, Emacs Lisp is more than a mere “extension language”; it is a full computer programming language in its own right. 
You can use it as you would any other programming language.

大多数情况下GNU Emacs 文本编辑器是在 Emacs Lisp 编程语言上编写的。 
你可以编写和安装新的代码用于扩展Emacs 编辑器。
然而， Emacs Lisp 不仅仅是一种扩展语言，它自己本身就具有完整的计算机编程语言能力。
你可以使用它就像你使用任何其他编程语言一样。

Because Emacs Lisp is designed for use in an editor, it has special features for scanning and parsing text as well as features for handling files, buffers, displays, subprocesses, and so on. Emacs Lisp is closely integrated with the editing facilities; thus, editing commands are functions that can also conveniently be called from Lisp programs, and parameters for customization are ordinary Lisp variables.

因为Emacs Lisp 被设计给编辑器使用， 它具有特殊功能用于扫描和解析以及处理文件、缓冲区、显示、子进程等等。
Emacs Lisp 与编辑功能的紧密结合；因此，编辑命令功能也可以很方便的被Lisp 程序调用，以及为普通Lisp 变量定制参数。
